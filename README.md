ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryuta Aoki, a Tokyo-based artistic director and social sculptor. I have been creating invisible structures that maximize people's creativity to explore the form of "society as it could be" that terraforms cultural deserts into cultural forests. I currently plans, designs, directs and implements research projects, exhibitions, and artworks in the interdisciplinary art and science technology field.
